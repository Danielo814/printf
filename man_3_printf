.SH NAME
.B _printf
- Formatted output conversion/
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include "holberton.h"

.B int_printf(const char *
.I format
.B , ...)
.SH Description
.B _printf()
Prints to the standard output using a 
.I format
string that specifies how arguments are converted for output.
.SH Return value
On succesful return, the functions will return the numbers of characters printed excluding the null byte.
If output error is found, a negative value will be returned.
.SH Format of the format string
The format string is a character string, composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), are copied to the output stream; and conversion specifications, which result in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments. Each conversion specification is introduced by the character  % , and ends with a conversion specifier.
.SH The conversion specifier
A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied. The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:
.TP
.BR c
The int argument is converted to an unsigned char, and the resulting character is written.
.TP
.B s
the const char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string). characters from the array are written up to (but not including) a terminating null byte.
.TP
.B d, i
The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation.
.TP
.B %
A '%' is written. No argument is converted. The complete conversion specification is '%%'.
.SH Bugs
There are no known bugs
.SH Example
To print a persons name, the first letter of their name, and their birthdate where name is a pointer to a string of characters, first letter of their name is a single character, and their birthdate is a combination of strings and integers you would provide the following input.


#include "holberton.h"


_printf("The name of the is user is %s, the first letter of their name is %c, their birthdate is %s %i, %d\n", name, letter, birthmonth, birthday, birthyear).
